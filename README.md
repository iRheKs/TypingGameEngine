## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple godot plugin made in gdScript that helps you create a typing game. For now it's really simple but the idea is to make it grow so it has more options. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Installing

Download the addons folder into your godot project. If you already have an addons folder just accept combination of the folders.
For more information go to [InstallingPlugins] (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html) from godot's official documentation.

### Prerequisites

You need a godot proyect to be able to install this plugin.

## üîß Examples <a name = "examples"></a>

Here you have some examples of use of the plugin.

### Scene: 1

In this example you can see how to create words that move and have lifespan. Getting the word right before despawning will give you points.

```gdscript
Give an example
```

### Scene: 2

In this example you can see how to create words that are static and have no lifespan. Failing to get the word right will get you killed if else you will kill the enemy.

```gdscript
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Normal mode

First create a node `WordController` this will create a node wich you can access from your game controller. 

### Singleton mode

If you wish the `WordController.gd` script can be added to the autoload settings so it can be used as a singleton. In this case, theres no need to add the controller as a node, but you will need to set your custom font and font size in runtime to the controller.


It's also possible to set a custom font to each word separately.
